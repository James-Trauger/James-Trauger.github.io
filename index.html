  <h2>Privacy Policy for Social Metrics</h2>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>2025-05-31<br>
     <strong>Last Updated:</strong>2025-05-31</p>

  <p><strong>Social Metrics</strong> (“Add-on”) is a Google Sheets add-on developed</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Add-on.</p>

  <p>By using the Add-on, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
  <p>The Add-on may access limited user data from your Google account, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Metadata about the spreadsheet you're working on (e.g., sheet names, ranges)</li>
    <li>Content from cells that you directly interact with via the Add-on</li>
    <li>Your Google account identity (e.g., email address) to associate usage with a user account or provide user-specific features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> access or store any other personal information or files from your Google account unless explicitly requested by you.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we access strictly to provide the core functionality of the Add-on, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Performing calculations or transformations on your spreadsheet data</li>
    <li>Generating reports, insights, or suggestions based on spreadsheet content</li>
    <li>Personalizing your experience within the Add-on</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> permanently store any spreadsheet content or personal data on our servers unless:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You explicitly submit information to us (e.g., via a feedback form)</li>
    <li>The Add-on requires server-side functionality (in which case, only minimal, necessary data is temporarily processed and then discarded)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Add-on may use third-party services (e.g., Google Analytics, Stripe) strictly to enhance performance and usability. These services have their own privacy policies which we encourage you to review.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>6. User Controls</h2>
  <p>You can manage or revoke the Add-on’s access to your Google account at any time via your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Add-on is not intended for children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes are made, we will notify you via the Add-on or by email (if provided).</p>
